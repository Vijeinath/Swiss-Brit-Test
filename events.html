                            <p>The next international SAMEMES conference will take place within the framework of the SNSF-project SwissBritNet: Swiss-British cultural exchange and knowledge networks 1600-1780. The conference will extend the investigation of these networks back through the Middle Ages.</p>
                            <p>The study of early modern transnational relations in Europe has been advanced in recent years by digital humanities initiatives enabling the large-scale collection, visualization and analysis of data designed to improve our understanding of knowledge networks and the Republic of Letters. Joining this international research community, SwissBritNet will highlight the nature and relevance of Swiss-British relations as an intrinsic part of a bigger European picture. While both continental Anglophilia and the British enthusiasm for Switzerland are often seen as late-18<sup>th</sup> century phenomena, this conference will show that they have a much longer and intricate history. From the 7<sup>th</sup> century Irish monks who established the monastery of St Gallen and the Bishop of Sion who helped found Westminster Abbey to the English envoys stationed in the Swiss confederacy in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, from the Genevan teacher Antoine-Rodolphe Chevalier, who was Professor of Hebrew at Cambridge in the reign of Edward VI to the English knowledge networks of Swiss theologians and scholars in the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries; from the Marian exiles in Basel and Geneva in the 1550s to Puritan regicides in Geneva and Lausanne – to name only a very few examples – there has been constant movement and cultural exchange between Switzerland and Britain, and considerable resulting mutual influence.</p>
                            <p>At the SAMEMES conference, we will be able to discuss medieval and early modern case studies as well as larger theoretical and methodological considerations, and the project database SwissBritNet will subsequently enable us to collect and link documents and stories that form part of this Swiss-British history (with an initial focus on early modern materials).</p>

                            <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                            <p>Complex flows of information define the twenty-first century as much as the early modern and the modern periods of history. Science, education, trades, crafts and other sites of the production of knowledge do not exist in a vacuum. They are part of global networks, systems and ecologies, which shape their internal workings and their exchanges with other actors, regulated by intricate mechanisms of feedback. These entanglements have been theorised by information and systems theory, actor-network theory and scientific approaches to chaos and complexity. Information is not only transmitted by sender and receiver, but can also be generated in open systems. This has far-reaching implications for the study of epistemic practices in the history of information.</p>
                            <p>This workshop engages with historical knowledge systems broadly conceived. It focuses on the web of information channelled through networks, institutions, environments and transnational spaces from the early modern to the modern age, c. 1400–1900. Three areas which we especially endorse are the mediation of epistemic cultures by go-betweens in local networks; institutions as networks of learning, which interact with other organisations; and the movement of information through long-distance routes of communication between Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. We are interested in Jesuit networks as much as in early modern universities, intelligencers of the Royal Society and the institutional networks of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. Furthermore, colonial contexts played important roles in global knowledge networks from the fifteenth century onwards, creating new power hierarchies in the Atlantic world, including the appropriation, misuse and theft of resources. Historical case studies on these or similar topics are thus as welcome as are theoretical contributions on information history.</p>
                            <p>The workshop is organised as a peer seminar and meets once a month. We discuss readings and short work-in-progress papers. We also organise guest lectures. The group meets on Zoom. For more information or if you are interested to join, please email globinfohistworkshop@gmail.com.</p>

                            <h5>Abstract:</h5>
                            <p>This research seminar takes place in the context of our SNSF-project SwissBritNet: Swiss-British Cultural Exchange and knowledge networks, 1600-1780. (This is a collaboration between English and Digital Humanities; for further information see https://forschdb2.unibas.ch/inf2/rm_projects/object_view.php?r=4664799). We will discuss the history and theory of travel writing as a genre and explore early modern British travel writing about Switzerland in terms of constructions of national and cultural identity, strategies of othering and mechanisms of cultural exchange. Authors discussed will include Thomas Coryat, Gilbert Burnet and Abraham Stanyan.</p>
                            <p>Students will widen their historical knowledge and improve their skills in reading texts that differ in style, structure and typography from modern publications. They will have a chance to participate in current research at the English department.</p>
                            <p>The travel accounts we will discuss are of varying length and are either to be found on the internet or will be available on the ADAM server space for the seminar in due course.</p>
